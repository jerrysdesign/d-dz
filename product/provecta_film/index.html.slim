          p Provecta is a series of advanced technical films designed to provide a better alternative to rubber and traditional plastic. Highly adaptable and extremely versatile, Provecta is excellent for use as a protective layer, adhesive, sealant, and cushion in both commercial and medical applications.
          p Our Provecta line offers a comprehensive range of ether-, ester-, bio-based, and recycled films, and as well as leading-edge foams and tapes.
          p.italic The name Provecta is derived from “provectus,” the Latin word for "advanced," and provides the ideal name for this line of leading-edge technical films.
